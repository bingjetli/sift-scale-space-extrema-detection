# Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)

&nbsp;  

## OVERVIEW

This is an implementation of the Scale Invariant Feature Transform detection algorithm by [David Lowe from the University of British Columbia](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/keypoints/) written *entirely in JavaScript*, HTML and CSS. 

&nbsp;  

Currently, the algorithm is only partially implemented up to the candidate keypoint detection phase. 
 
&nbsp;  

No external APIs or modules were used in the development of this project, everything was written entirely from scratch. As a result, some algorithms may not be using their most optimized implementations (e.g the Gaussian Blur uses a traditional 2D kernel instead of the separated 1D kernel). I wanted to strike a balance between having an optimized implementation along with something I can intuitively understand.
